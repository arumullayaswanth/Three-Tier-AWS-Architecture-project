## üßæ Execution Plan: Three-Tier Web Architecture on AWS

### ‚úÖ Objective:
To build and deploy a scalable, secure, and highly available Three-Tier Web Application Architecture on AWS using best practices, automation, and monitoring tools.

---

| Subnets (Public/Private)| Separate workloads logically and securely              |
| Internet Gateway       | Enable internet access for web tier                      |
| NAT Gateway            | Allow private instances (app/db) to access the internet  |
| Elastic IP             | Static IP for NAT Gateway                                |
| Route Tables           | Control traffic routing between subnets                  |
| Amazon CloudWatch (optional) | Monitor instance performance, scaling policies |

### Overview
Three main layers:
1. **Web Tier**: Handles client requests and serves the front-end website.
2. **Application Tier**: Processes API requests and handles the business logic.
3. **Database Tier**: Manages data storage and retrieval.

---

### Components Explanation

#### 1. External Load Balancer
- **Role**: Entry point for all client traffic.
- **Functionality**:
  - Distributes requests to web tier EC2s.
  - Performs health checks.

#### 2. Web Tier
- **Role**: Serves front-end and routes API calls.
- **Components**: Nginx on EC2, React.js front-end.
- **Functionality**:
  - Serve static files.
  - Redirect API to internal ALB.

#### 3. Internal Load Balancer
- **Role**: Manages traffic between Web and App Tier.
- **Functionality**:
  - Routes API calls to App EC2s.
  - Ensures high availability.

#### 4. Application Tier
- **Role**: Handles business logic.
- **Components**: Node.js on EC2.
- **Functionality**:
  - Process requests.
  - Interact with DB.
  - Return data to Web Tier.

#### 5. Database Tier
- **Role**: Reliable data storage.
- **Functionality**:
  - Structured data storage.
  - Multi-AZ high availability.
  - SQL queries and transactions.

---

### Additional Components

#### Load Balancing
- Ensures even traffic distribution.
- Implemented at both Web and App tiers.

#### Health Checks
- External ALB checks Web EC2s.
- Internal ALB checks App EC2s.

#### Auto Scaling Groups
- Web Tier and App Tier auto-scale based on metrics.

#### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- SSL/TLS for `learnaws.co.in`.
- Auto-renew and bind with external ALB.

#### Amazon Route 53
- DNS management for `learnaws.co.in`.
- Routing and health-check-based failover.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary
This architecture ensures **high availability**, **scalability**, and **reliability** by:
- Load balancing traffic across tiers.
- Monitoring instance health.
- Auto-scaling based on usage metrics.
- Isolated networking via VPC and Subnets.
